## My process
### Selecting the Tools / Technologies
I decided to use Next.js because of the new features   Next.js gives to a React application.

### Planning the Layouts
I then took the time to consider the various views and UI components that would be needed for the application.

### Building the Views 
I then wrote code for everything planned and still planning
### Built with

- Next.js
- Tailwindcss
- Flexbox
- fontawesome

## What I learned

This project helped me learn about the various features of Next. From file based routing to all the optimizations Next undertakes to keep the application fast at all levels.

This project also allowed me to
- learn about caching techniques such as local storage
- working with APIs to achieve a goal
- implement tailwindcss in a Next app



```html
 <section className="w-[fit-content] h-1/2">
              <section className='py-4'>
                <h1 className='text-7xl font-bold pb-5 '> {city}, {country_code}</h1>
                <p> {today}</p>
                </section>
 <section />
```


## Continued development
<!-- Further on in this project, I would like to
- Access to location data o
- Keep a list favourite locations
- Provide more information on the weather of a location
- Important world events that ocurred with specific weather conditions -->

## Useful resources

<!-- - [Tailwind official docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me with using tailwindcss for the project. I really liked the simplicity and the ctrl + K shortcut for searching. -->


**However, I am open to alternatives so reach out to me if you have any.**
